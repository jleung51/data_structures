# binary_tree
C++ implementations of a binary tree class (unsorted/sorted) and related methods.

###TODO:
1. Write an implementation where the tree (rather than the node itself) is an actual data structure.
2. Implement predecessor/successor removal.
3. Implement Find( value ) function.
4. Implement Count( value ) function.
3. Implement rotation of the tree.
4. Implement red-black binary tree implementation.
